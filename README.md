# Cpp03Pointers

## About

Back when I was using an IDE built on C++ 03 to create Windows programs, I didn't have the luxury of std::unique_ptr to handle arrays, so I implemented my own versions called ScopedPointer and ScopedArray. It was a fun little exercise that worked out very well. This short example demonstrates their usage.
